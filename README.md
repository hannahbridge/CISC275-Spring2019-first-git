3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?
      yes, the comparator constructor call is part of the parameters         for Collections.sort
      the class definition is in the same place where the constructor        call is (its part of the parameters for Collections.sort as well)       and its also in the same MyCompare3 java file
